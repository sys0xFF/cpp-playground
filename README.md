# Path to C++

**Path to C++** is a personal journey to master the C++ programming language from scratch, using a structured 5-week roadmap filled with hands-on lessons, challenges, and real-world projects.

Every file and commit in this repository represents a step forward. The goal is consistency, depth, and evolution — one `.cpp` at a time.

## Weekly Roadmap

### Week 01 – Fundamentals
> Getting comfortable with the syntax and core logic of C++

- Variables, data types, and basic I/O
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions and code structure
- Exercises: Calculator, Guessing Game, Option Menu

### Week 02 – Arrays and Strings
> Learning how to handle collections of data and character manipulation

- 1D and 2D arrays
- C-style strings and `std::string`
- Structs and basic data grouping
- Exercises: Grades Average, Palindrome, Tic-Tac-Toe

### Week 03 – Pointers and Memory
> Diving into low-level control and dynamic allocation

- Pointers and references
- Memory allocation with `new` / `delete`
- Passing by reference vs. by value
- Exercises: Dynamic List, Pointer Swap, Dynamic Registration

### Week 04 – Object-Oriented Programming
> Embracing the power of abstraction and reusability

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation and access modifiers
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Operator overloading
- Exercises: Banking System, RPG Simulator, Inventory Manager

### Week 05 – STL & Final Project
> Exploring the Standard Template Library and building something real

- `vector`, `map`, `set`, `queue`, `stack`
- Algorithms (`sort`, `find`, `for_each`)
- Full revision of previous topics
- Final Projects: Quiz App, Contact Manager

## How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` installed.

To compile and run a file:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o program
./program
```

## Goals

- Build a strong and deep understanding of C++
- Practice daily through small but meaningful code sessions
- Use Git effectively for versioning and progress tracking
- End the journey with real, functional C++ mini-projects

## Why This Exists

I believe in learning by building. Instead of passively consuming tutorials, this repo is my way of making the process active, visible, and consistent. If you're reading this and want to follow a similar path — feel free to fork, clone, or just get inspired.
