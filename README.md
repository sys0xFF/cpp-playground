# C++ Playground

**C++ Playground** is my personal sandbox for mastering the C++ programming language.  
It’s where I experiment, break things, rebuild, and evolve — one `.cpp` file at a time.

This repository started as a structured 5-week roadmap, but has grown into a complete playground:  
a space for following courses (like Alura), trying out new algorithms, building small projects, and deepening my knowledge by writing code consistently.

## Structure

- **path-to-cpp/**  
  My original 5-week journey from fundamentals to STL & mini-projects.

- **alura-cpp/**  
  Exercises, challenges and modules from the Alura C++ course.

- **playground/**  
  A free zone for testing data structures, small snippets, or anything I’m curious about.

## How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` installed.

To compile and run:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o program
./program
```

## Goals

- Build a deep understanding of modern C++
- Practice daily through focused, incremental coding
- Use Git for versioning and progress tracking
- End up with a collection of real, functional mini-projects
